# String_reverse_in_pairs
The task was to perform the string reverse operation but it was to done in pairs. For ex. if the input string was "tanmay" and it was to be reversed in pair of 3 so firstly we break the string in pair of 3 i.e "tan" and "may" and reverse them individually "tan" changes to "nat" and "may"changes to "yam" so the reversed string would be "natyam".

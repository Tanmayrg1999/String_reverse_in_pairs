# String_reverse_in_pairs
Strings are used for storing text.A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes.There are certain operations that can be done over a string.

The task was to perform the string reverse operation but it was to done in pairs. For ex. if the input string was "tanmay" and it was to be reversed in pair of 3 so firstly we break the string in pair of 3 i.e "tan" and "may" and reverse them individually "tan" changes to "nat" and "may"changes to "yam" so the reversed string would be "natyam".
A user defined reverse function was made which had the string the starting and the ending index as the input arguments and it returned the resulting reversed string for the given pattern. This function was called repeatedly untill the end of input string.
